## Information Related to Completed Projects:

## Task 2 - Movie Recommendation System.

- **Project Description**: Build a basic movie recommendation system that suggests movies
to users based on their viewing history or preferences. This project will introduce you to
the concepts of collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation.

- **Steps you can Implement**:

- **Data Collection**: Gather movie data, including titles, genres, and user ratings. You can find movie datasets on websites like Kaggle or use publicly available data sources.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and ensuring it's in a suitable format for your recommendation system.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the data to gain insights, such as the distribution of movie ratings, the most popular genres, and user preferences.

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm, which recommends movies to users based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes. You can use techniques like user-based or item-based collaborative filtering.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Implement a content-based recommendation system that suggests movies similar to the ones a user has already watched and liked. You can use movie genres, directors, and actors as features.

- **User Interface**: Create a simple user interface where users can input their movie preferences or view their recommended movies. This could be a command-line interface or a basic web application.

- **Recommendation Engine**: Combine the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.

- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the recommendation system's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for collaborative filtering and precision, recall, or F1-score for content-based filtering.

- **Testing**: Test the recommendation system with sample users and collect feedback to improve its accuracy and user experience.

- **Documentation**: Document your project, including the data sources, algorithms used, and any challenges you faced. This documentation will be valuable for future reference.
